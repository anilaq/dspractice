    "The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with a mean and standard deviation and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately distributed. It establishes that in many situtations, when independent random variables are added, they are properly normalised sum tends toward the normal distribution (bell curve) even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. This is important in probability and statistics because it means that if this concept works towards normal distributions it can therefore be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions. \n",
