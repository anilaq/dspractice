    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are fundamental to nearly all programming languages and have already been used a few times before this chapter. A function is a set of programming statements that can be referenced by a name. Functions allow you to store code that you would like to reference repeatedly without having to rewrite that same code for each execution. In this chapter, we will begin by examining the built-in functions that Python has already created for you before learning how to create our own functions. Functions are used very frequently when programming and really give you a lot of power to complete different tasks. You'll be able to develop much more elaborate programs by knowing how to create and use functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function calling\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are referenced by their name. To execute the code they are referencing, you must append an open and closing parentheses to that name. When we execute this code, we say that we are **calling** the function. Some functions accept **arguments** that are used to modify the behavior of the function. Arguments are values that are **passed** to the function by placing them in the parentheses following the function name. Each argument must be separated by a comma. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help us understand function calling syntax, let's take a look at three different examples and identify the arguments. Below, we have three functions with the names `func1`, `func2`, and `func3`. They are each called with a different number of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "func1(a, 5, [1, 2, 3], d)\n",
    "func2('python, java, go, c++')\n",
    "func3()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Function `func1` is called with 4 arguments - the value referenced by variable `a`, the integer `5`, the list `[1, 2, 3]`, and the value referenced by variable `d`. Function `func2` is called with a single argument, the string `'python, java, go, c++'`. Some functions accept no arguments, such as `func3`, which is called with nothing within its parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-in functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's official documentation lists all the [built-in functions][1] that are available and ready to use immediately in any program without any need to import them from other modules. These functions provide us with the ability to complete some of the most basic and common programming tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using built-in functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now cover several of the built-in functions and how they may be used with the objects and constructs that we have already covered in this book. An exhaustive list of examples for each function will not be provided here as many of the functions have use-cases for advanced topics that have yet to be covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### All functions return an object\n",
    "\n",
    "Every function in Python returns an object. It is always valid to assign the result of a function to a variable. For instance `a = func()` will always assign something to `a`. Some functions will appear to return nothing, but this isn't ever the case. When a function appears to return nothing, it is usually returning the object `None`. We will see a few functions in this chapter that return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Math functions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several built-in functions that are primarily used to do basic mathematical operations, although some of them may be used on non-numeric types. Examples for each one of these will be given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `abs` - returns the absolute value of a number\n",
    "* `divmod` - return the quotient and remainder for a division between two numbers\n",
    "* `min` - finds the minimum of a sequence\n",
    "* `max` - finds the maximum of a sequence\n",
    "* `pow` - raises a number to a power\n",
    "* `round` - rounds a number to the nearest given decimal place\n",
    "* `sum` - calculates the sum of an iterable\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abs` function returns the absolute value of the single numeric argument that it accepts. Let's take the absolute value of -5.\n",
    "\n",

    "<span style=\"color:green\">This is a classic interview Exercise. Write a function that finds the degree difference between the minute and second on a clock. The function will accept two arguments, hour (between 1 and 12) and minute (between 0 and 59). Note: this should be the absolute difference, so 180 degrees would be the absolute max possible value. Test your function with some times and make sure it makes sense. </span>"
